XSS Vulnerability: Unsafe DOM Manipulation. User controlled data in methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML` or `document.write` is an anti-pattern that can lead to XSS vulnerabilities. Replace with safe DOM methods: Use createElement() + appendChild() + textContent for dynamic content. Avoid use innerHTML with user data: Even escaped data can be risky. If HTML injection is absolutely necessary: Sanitize with DOMPurify library first.

Detected calls to child_process from a function argument `command`. This could lead to a command injection if the input is user controllable. Try to avoid calls to child_process, and if it is needed ensure user input is correctly sanitized or sandboxed.
